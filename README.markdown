cog
=====

`cog` is a command line utility that makes it a bit easier to organize a project
which uses code generation.

_It is still in early development! I would not recommend using it until this message gets removed._

Get it
------

From a terminal

```bash
gem install cog
```

or in your Gemfile

```ruby
gem "cog", "~> 0.0.11"
```

Prepare a project
-----------------

Consider an existing project with the following directory layout

```
PROJECT_ROOT/
             Makefile
             src/
                 main.cpp
                 ...
```

To use `cog` with this project, you would first open a terminal and change to
the `PROJECT_ROOT` directory. Then enter

```bash
cog init
```

Now your project's directory layout will look like this

```
PROJECT_ROOT/
           + Cogfile
             Makefile
             src/
                 main.cpp
                 ...
           + cog/
           +     generators/
           +     templates/
```

The [Cogfile](http://ktonon.github.com/cog/Cog/Config/Cogfile.html) configures
`cog` for use with your project. In short, it tells `cog` where to find sources
and where to put generated code. It should look like this when you first create
it

```ruby
# All paths are relative to the directory containing this file.

# Define the directory in which to find project generators
project_generators_path 'cog/generators'

# Define the directory in which to find custom project templates
project_templates_path 'cog/templates'

# Define the directory to which project source code is generated
project_source_path 'src'

# Define the default language in which to generated application source code
language 'c++'
```

Generators
----------

Very loosely, a generator is a ruby file which resides in the `project_generators_path`
and looks something like this

```ruby
require 'cog'

class MyGenerator
  include Cog::Generator
  
  def generate
    @context_var1 = 1
    @context_var2 = 2
    stamp 'my_generator/template1.cpp', 'path/to/generated/file1.cpp'
    stamp 'my_generator/template2.java', 'path/to/generated/file2.java'
    # ...
  end
end

Cog.register MyGenerator.new
```

There are three things to note here

* `Cog.register` must be called exactly once for each generator.
* The object passed to the register method must have a method named `generate` which takes no arguments and is responsible for generating source code from templates.
* The name the generator is registered under is implicitly the file's base name, without the extension. For example, if this file was called `cog/generators/my_generator.rb`, then the registered name would be `my_generator`.

The inclusion of the mixin
[Cog::Generator](http://ktonon.github.com/cog/Cog/Generator.html) is a
convenience, but is practically always done. It provides an interface for easily
generating source code from templates. The
[stamp](http://ktonon.github.com/cog/Cog/Generator.html#method-i-stamp) method
is particularly useful. If finds an ERB template on the template lookup path and
renders it to a file under the `project_source_path`. The
`project_templates_path` is on the template lookup path, and takes the highest
precedence (but there are two other possible paths, see below for more details).

Tools
-----

While its possible to place all the code for your generator in the
`project_generators_path`, you might also consider writing a tool.

A tool is a separately distribute ruby gem which can be registered with `cog`
and contains templates for generator files. A tool should also provide a domain
specific language (DSL) in which the generator files created by the tool are
written.

You can tell `cog` to help you get started writing a tool. For example, if you
wanted to write a command line interface generation tool and call it `cons`, you
would do this

```bash
cog tool cons
```

In this scenario, the following directory structure would be generated

```
cons/
     cog/
         templates/
                   cons/                 - for templates used by the cons tool
                        generator.rb.erb - a template for the default generator
     lib/
         cons.rb                         - contains the Cons module and boilerplate tool code
         cons/
              version.rb                 - adds VERSION to the Cons module
     LICENSE
     README.markdown
     API.rdoc
     cons.gemspec
     Gemfile
     Rakefile

```

API Documentation
-----------------

To get the most out of `cog` you'll need to refer to the [API docs](http://ktonon.github.com/cog/).
